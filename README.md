1. First, open the dataset file. Try to find which variables can help you find insights to reach business objectives.

2. Using the IF functions and text functions, create variables that can help sort the data in a better way.

3. Check if any missing values are using the filter.

4. Create pivot tables and charts that can provide useful insights and conclusions.

5. Create a sheet that has all the pivot charts and insert a slicer that can help in filtering out the dashboard according to your needs.

6. There is the Excel Project PDF file in which I have written whatever insights I was able to find and gave some recommendations.
